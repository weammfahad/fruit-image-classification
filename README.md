# Fruit Image Classification using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the "Deep Learning with Keras & TensorFlow" course by IBM on Coursera.

The project uses transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture to classify fruit images into multiple categories.

## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled fruit images used to train and evaluate the deep learning model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Transfer Learning (VGG16)
- Google Colab

## Project Workflow
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Feature extraction using pretrained VGG16
- Model training and evaluation
- Multi-class image classification

## Project File
The implementation is available in the Jupyter Notebook file.
